	abstract = {In the last twenty-five years (1990-2014), algorithmic advances in integer optimization combined with hardware improvements have resulted in an astonishing 200 billion factor speedup in solving Mixed Integer Optimization (MIO) problems. We present a MIO approach for solving the classical best subset selection problem of choosing \$k\$ out of \$p\$ features in linear regression given \$n\$ observations. We develop a discrete extension of modern first order continuous optimization methods to find high quality feasible solutions that we use as warm starts to a MIO solver that finds provably optimal solutions. The resulting algorithm (a) provides a solution with a guarantee on its suboptimality even if we terminate the algorithm early, (b) can accommodate side constraints on the coefficients of the linear regression and (c) extends to finding best subset solutions for the least absolute deviation loss function. Using a wide variety of synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate that our approach solves problems with \$n\$ in the 1000s and \$p\$ in the 100s in minutes to provable optimality, and finds near optimal solutions for \$n\$ in the 100s and \$p\$ in the 1000s in minutes. We also establish via numerical experiments that the MIO approach performs better than \{{\textbackslash}texttt \{Lasso\}\} and other popularly used sparse learning procedures, in terms of achieving sparse solutions with good predictive power.},

	abstract = {We address the Least Quantile of Squares (LQS) (and in particular the Least Median of Squares) regression problem using modern optimization methods. We propose a Mixed Integer Optimization (MIO) formulation of the LQS problem which allows us to find a provably global optimal solution for the LQS problem. Our MIO framework has the appealing characteristic that if we terminate the algorithm early, we obtain a solution with a guarantee on its sub-optimality. We also propose continuous optimization methods based on first-order subdifferential methods, sequential linear optimization and hybrid combinations of them to obtain near optimal solutions to the LQS problem. The MIO algorithm is found to benefit significantly from high quality solutions delivered by our continuous optimization based methods. We further show that the MIO approach leads to (a) an optimal solution for any dataset, where the data-points \$(y\_i,{\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}\_i)\$'s are not necessarily in general position, (b) a simple proof of the breakdown point of the LQS objective value that holds for any dataset and (c) an extension to situations where there are polyhedral constraints on the regression coefficient vector. We report computational results with both synthetic and real-world datasets showing that the MIO algorithm with warm starts from the continuous optimization methods solve small (\$n=100\$) and medium (\$n=500\$) size problems to provable optimality in under two hours, and outperform all publicly available methods for large-scale (\$n=\{\}\$10,000) LQS problems.},

First, under some regularity conditions, we establish the asymptotic normality and weak consistency of the WNW conditional distribution estimator for Î±-mixing time series at both boundary and interior points, and we show that the WNW conditional distribution estimator not only preserves the bias, variance, and, more important, automatic good boundary behavior properties of local linear "double-kernel" estimators introduced by Yu and Jones (1998, "Journal of the American Statistical Association" 93, 228-237), but also has the additional advantage of always being a distribution itself. Second, it is shown that under some regularity conditions, the WNW conditional quantile estimator is weakly consistent and normally distributed and that it inherits all good properties from the WNW conditional distribution estimator. A small simulation study is carried out to illustrate the performance of the estimates, and a real example is also used to demonstrate the methodology.},

	abstract = {We propose a notion of conditional vector quantile function and a vector quantile regression. A {\textbackslash}emph\{conditional vector quantile function\} (CVQF) of a random vector \$Y\$, taking values in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$ given covariates \$Z=z\$, taking values in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\% {\textasciicircum}k\$, is a map \$u {\textbackslash}longmapsto Q\_\{Y{\textbackslash}mid Z\}(u,z)\$, which is monotone, in the sense of being a gradient of a convex function, and such that given that vector \$U\$ follows a reference non-atomic distribution \$F\_U\$, for instance uniform distribution on a unit cube in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$, the random vector \$Q\_\{Y{\textbackslash}mid Z\}(U,z)\$ has the distribution of \$Y\$ conditional on \$Z=z\$. Moreover, we have a strong representation, \$Y = Q\_\{Y{\textbackslash}mid Z\}(U,Z)\$ almost surely, for some version of \$U\$. The {\textbackslash}emph\{vector quantile regression\} (VQR) is a linear model for CVQF of \$Y\$ given \$Z\$. Under correct specification, the notion produces strong representation, \$Y={\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}left(U{\textbackslash}right) {\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}top f(Z)\$, for \$f(Z)\$ denoting a known set of transformations of \$Z\$, where \$u {\textbackslash}longmapsto {\textbackslash}beta(u){\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}top f(Z)\$ is a monotone map, the gradient of a convex function, and the quantile regression coefficients \$u {\textbackslash}longmapsto {\textbackslash}beta(u)\$ have the interpretations analogous to that of the standard scalar quantile regression. As \$f(Z)\$ becomes a richer class of transformations of \$Z\$, the model becomes nonparametric, as in series modelling. A key property of VQR is the embedding of the classical Monge-Kantorovich's optimal transportation problem at its core as a special case. In the classical case, where \$Y\$ is scalar, VQR reduces to a version of the classical QR, and CVQF reduces to the scalar conditional quantile function. An application to multiple Engel curve estimation is considered.},

However, most of the specification tests (also called backtests) available in the literature, such as Christoffersen (1998) and Engle and Manganelli (2004) are based on such variables. In this article we propose a new backtest that does not rely solely on binary variables. It is shown that the new backtest provides a sufficient condition to assess the finite sample performance of a quantile model whereas the existing ones do not. The proposed methodology allows us to identify periods of an increased risk exposure based on a quantile regression model (Koenker and Xiao 2002). Our theoretical findings are corroborated through a Monte Carlo simulation and an empirical exercise with daily S\&P500 time series.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2931},
	abstract = {We consider median regression and, more generally, a possibly infinite collection of quantile regressions in high-dimensional sparse models. In these models the overall number of regressors \$p\$ is very large, possibly larger than the sample size \$n\$, but only \$s\$ of these regressors have non-zero impact on the conditional quantile of the response variable, where \$s\$ grows slower than \$n\$. We consider quantile regression penalized by the \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-norm of coefficients (\${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-QR). First, we show that \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-QR is consistent at the rate \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s/n\} {\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}log p\}\$. The overall number of regressors \$p\$ affects the rate only through the \${\textbackslash}log p\$ factor, thus allowing nearly exponential growth in the number of zero-impact regressors. The rate result holds under relatively weak conditions, requiring that \$s/n\$ converges to zero at a super-logarithmic speed and that regularization parameter satisfies certain theoretical constraints. Second, we propose a pivotal, data-driven choice of the regularization parameter and show that it satisfies these theoretical constraints. Third, we show that \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-QR correctly selects the true minimal model as a valid submodel, when the non-zero coefficients of the true model are well separated from zero. We also show that the number of non-zero coefficients in \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-QR is of same stochastic order as \$s\$. Fourth, we analyze the rate of convergence of a two-step estimator that applies ordinary quantile regression to the selected model. Fifth, we evaluate the performance of \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-QR in a Monte-Carlo experiment, and illustrate its use on an international economic growth application.},

The approach has several advantages, such as no distributional assumptions and flexible inclusion of predictive information.

The data used is 15-min observations of solar power from 21 PV systems located on rooftops in a small village in Denmark. The suggested method is a two-stage method where first a statistical normalization of the solar power is obtained using a clear sky model. The clear sky model is found using statistical smoothing techniques. Then forecasts of the normalized solar power are calculated using adaptive linear time series models. Both autoregressive (AR) and AR with exogenous input (ARX) models are evaluated, where the latter takes numerical weather predictions (NWPs) as input. The results indicate that for forecasts up to 2h ahead the most important input is the available observations of solar power, while for longer horizons NWPs are the most important input. A root mean square error improvement of around 35\% is achieved by the ARX model compared to a proposed reference model.},

TheÂ method consists in sorting or monotone rearranging the original estimated non-monotone curve into a monotone rearranged curve. We show that the rearranged curve is closer to the true quantile curve than the original curve in finite samples, establish a functional delta method for rearrangement-related operators, and derive functional limit theory for the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. We also establish validity of the bootstrap for estimating the limit law of the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. Our limit results are generic in that they apply to every estimator of a monotone function, provided that the estimator satisfies a functional central limit theorem and the function satisfies some smoothness conditions. Consequently, our results apply to estimation of other econometric functions with monotonicity restrictions, such as demand, production, distribution, and structural distribution functions. We illustrate the results with an application to estimation of structural distribution and quantile functions using data on Vietnam veteran status and earnings.},

The majority of the wind forecasting tools available in the literature provide deterministic prediction, but given the variability and uncertainty of wind, such predictions limit the use of the existing tools for decision-making under uncertain conditions. As a result, probabilistic forecasting, which provides information on uncertainty associated with wind power forecasting, is gaining increased attention. This paper presents a novel hybrid intelligent algorithm for deterministic wind power forecasting that utilizes a combination of wavelet transform (WT) and fuzzy ARTMAP (FA) network, which is optimized by using firefly (FF) optimization algorithm. In addition, support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to minimize the wind power forecast error obtained from WT+FA+FF. The paper also presents a probabilistic wind power forecasting algorithm using quantile regression method. It uses the wind power forecast results obtained from the proposed hybrid deterministic WT+FA+FF+SVM model to evaluate the probabilistic forecasting performance. The performance of the proposed forecasting model is assessed utilizing wind power data from the Cedar Creek wind farm in Colorado.},

In recent years, however, quantile regression has emerged as a comprehensive approach to the statistical analysis of response models. In this article we consider the L1-norm (LASSO) regularized quantile regression (L1-norm QR), which uses the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients as the penalty. The L1-norm penalty has the advantage of simultaneously controlling the variance of the fitted coefficients and performing automatic variable selection. We propose an efficient algorithm that computes the entire solution path of the L1-norm QR. Furthermore, we derive an estimate for the effective dimension of the L1-norm QR model, which allows convenient selection of the regularization parameter.},

The method is based on the estimation of marginal wage distributions consistent with a conditional distribution estimated by quantile regression as well as with any hypothesized distribution for the covariates. Comparing the marginal distributions implied by different distributions for the covariates, one is then able to perform counterfactual exercises. The proposed methodology enables the identification of the sources of the increased wage inequality observed in most countries. Specifically, it decomposes the changes in the wage distribution over a period of time into several factors contributing to those changes, namely by discriminating between changes in the characteristics of the working population and changes in the returns to these characteristics. We apply this methodology to Portuguese data for the period 1986â1995, and find that the observed increase in educational levels contributed decisively towards greater wage inequality.

	abstract = {The randomness and intermittence of wind resources is the biggest challenge in the integration of wind power into the power system. Accurate forecasting of wind power generation is an efficient tool to deal with such problem. Conventional wind power forecasting produces a value, or the conditional expectation of wind power output at a time point in the future. However, any prediction involves inherent uncertainty. In recent years, several probabilistic forecasting approaches have been reported in wind power forecasting studies. Compared to currently wide-used point forecasts, probabilistic forecasts could provide additional quantitative information on the uncertainty associated with wind power generation. For decision-makings in the uncertainty environment, probabilistic forecasts are optimal inputs. A review of state-of-the-art methods and new developments in wind power probabilistic forecasting is presented in this paper. Firstly, three different representations of wind power uncertainty are briefly introduced. Then, different forecasting methods are discussed. These methods are classified into three categories in terms of uncertainty representation, i.e. probabilistic forecasts (parametric and non-parametric), risk index forecasts and space-time scenario forecasts. Finally, requirements and the overall framework of the uncertainty forecasting evaluation are summarized. In addition, this article also describes current challenges and future developments associated with wind power probabilistic prediction.},

	abstract = {Short-term (up to 2â3 days ahead) probabilistic forecasts of wind power provide forecast users with highly valuable information on the uncertainty of expected wind generation. Whatever the type of these probabilistic forecasts, they are produced on a per horizon basis, and hence do not inform on the development of the forecast uncertainty through forecast series. However, this additional information may be paramount for a large class of time-dependent and multistage decision-making problems, e.g. optimal operation of combined wind-storage systems or multiple-market trading with different gate closures. This issue is addressed here by describing a method that permits the generation of statistical scenarios of short-term wind generation that accounts for both the interdependence structure of prediction errors and the predictive distributions of wind power production. The method is based on the conversion of series of prediction errors to a multivariate Gaussian random variable, the interdependence structure of which can then be summarized by a unique covariance matrix. Such matrix is recursively estimated in order to accommodate long-term variations in the prediction error characteristics. The quality and interest of the methodology are demonstrated with an application to the test case of a multi-MW wind farm over a period of more than 2 years.

	abstract = {Smart electricity meters are currently deployed in millions of households to collect detailed individual electricity consumption data. Compared with traditional electricity data based on aggregated consumption, smart meter data are much more volatile and less predictable. There is a need within the energy industry for probabilistic forecasts of household electricity consumption to quantify the uncertainty of future electricity demand in order to undertake appropriate planning of generation and distribution. We propose to estimate an additive quantile regression model for a set of quantiles of the future distribution using a boosting procedure. By doing so, we can benefit from flexible and interpretable models, which include an automatic variable selection. We compare our approach with three benchmark methods on both aggregated and disaggregated scales using a smart meter data set collected from 3639 households in Ireland at 30-min intervals over a period of 1.5 years. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach based on quantile regression provides better forecast accuracy for disaggregated demand, while the traditional approach based on a normality assumption (possibly after an appropriate Box-Cox transformation) is a better approximation for aggregated demand. These results are particularly useful since more energy data will become available at the disaggregated level in the future.},

Quantiles with different proportions can be directly produced via an innovatively formulated linear programming optimization model, without dependency on point forecasts. Multistep probabilistic forecasting of 10-min wind power is newly carried out based on real wind farm data from Bornholm Island in Denmark. The superiority of the proposed approach is verified through comparisons with other well-established benchmarks.

We first prove that the obtained estimators satisfy the oracle properties, which involves the relevant variable selection without using hypothesis test. Next, we study the proposed method when the (multiphase) model changes to unknown observations called change-points. Convergence rates of the change-points and of the regression parameter estimators in each phase are found. The sparsity of the adaptive LASSO quantile estimators of the regression parameters is not affected by the change-points estimation. If the number of phases is unknown, a consistent criterion is proposed. Numerical studies by Monte Carlo simulations show the performance of the proposed method, compared to other existing methods in the literature, for models with a single phase or for multiphase models.

\section{Quantile Autoregression}

Our main objective in this paper is estimating the p-step ahead $\alpha$-quantile function $\mathcal{Q}_{y_t|y_{t-p}}^\alpha(t)$ for a given set of time series data $y_t$, as the one on figure \ref{fig:exemployt}. So, given a sequence $\{y_t\}$, we can pair an observation $y_t$ with its $p$-lagged correspondent $y_{t-p}$. Figure \ref{fig:exemploar} shows this relationship. We will assume that all information regarding the estimated quantile value are past observations, being in accordance with other pure autoregressive models.

We will investigate two ways of estimating the quantiles for the aforementioned relationship: we will use a linear and a nonparametric model.

\section{Linear-QAR}



\section{NP-QAR}

Fitting a linear estimator for the Quantile Auto Regression isn't appropriate  when nonlinearity is present in the data. This nonlinearity may produce a linear estimator that underestimates the quantile for a chunk of data while overestimating for the other chunk (we illustrate this in figure \ref{fig:nonlinear}). To prevent this issue from occurring we propose a modification which we let the prediction $\mathcal{Q}_{y_t|y_{t-1}}^\alpha(t)$ adjust freely to the data and its nonlinearities. To prevent overfitting and smoothen our predictor, we include a penalty on its roughness by including the $\ell_1$ norm of its second derivative. For more information on the $\ell_1$ norm acting as a filter, one can refer to \cite{kim2009ell_1}.

Let $\{\tilde{y}_t \}_{t=1}^n$ be the sequence of observations in time $t$. Now, let $\tilde{x}_t$ be the $p-$lagged time series of $\tilde{y}_t$, such that $\tilde{x}_t = L^p(\tilde{y}_t)$, where $L$ is the lag operator. Matching each observation $\tilde{y}_t$ with its $p-$lagged correspondent $\tilde{x}_t$ will produce $n-p$ pairs $\{(\tilde{y}_t,\tilde{x}_t)\}_{t=p+1}^n$ (note that the first $p$ observations of $y_t$ must be discarded). Consider $J$ to be the set of indexes such that
$$\tilde{x}_{J_1} \leq \tilde{x}_{J_2} \leq \dots \leq \tilde{x}_{J_{n-P}}.$$ 
Now, we define $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^{n-p} = \{\tilde{x}_{J_t} \}_{t=p+1}^{n}$ and $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^{n-p} = \{\tilde{y}_{J_t} \}_{t=p+1}^{n}$ and $I = \{2,\dots, n-p-1\}$. As we need the second difference of $q_i$, $I$ has to be shortened by two elements.

Our optimization model to estimate the nonparametric quantile is as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{Q}_{y_t|y_{t-1}}^\alpha(i) =\underset{q_{i}}{\arg\min}\sum_{i\in I}\left(|y_{i}-q_{i}|^{+}\alpha + |y_{i}-q_{i}|^{-}(1-\alpha)\right) \\ +\lambda  \sum_{i\in I}|D^{2}q_{i}|,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $D^2 q_t$ is the second derivative of the $q_t$ function, calculated as follows:
\begin{equation*}
D^{2}q_{i}=\left(\frac{q_{i+1}-q_{i}}{x_{i+1}-x_{i}}\right)-\left(\frac{q_{i}-q_{i-1}}{x_{i}-x_{i-1}}\right).
\end{equation*}
The first part on the objective function is the usual quantile regression condition for $\{q_i\}$. The second part is the $\ell_1$-filter. The purpose of a filter is to control the amount of variation for our estimator $q_i$. When no penalty is employed we would always get $q_i = y_i$. On the other hand, when $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$, our estimator approaches the linear quantile regression.

The output of our optimization problem is a sequence of ordered points $\{(x_i, q_i)\}_{i \in I}$. The next step is to interpolate these points in order to provide an estimation for any other value of x. To address this issue, we propose a B-splines interpolation, that will be discussed in another subsection.

When estimating quantiles for a few different values of $\alpha$, however, sometimes we find them overlapping each other, which we call crossing quantiles. To prevent this, we include a non-crossing constraint:
\begin{equation}
q_i^{\alpha} \leq q_i^{\alpha'}, \quad \forall i \in I, \alpha < \alpha'.
\end{equation}

	In this work, a novel allocation model to optimally assess a portfolio of call options to hedge the price and quantity risk induced by renewable trading in forward market is presented. The proposed approach extend the classical risk-constrained models to include different degrees of aversion to ambiguity on spot price probability distribution. We make use of the hybrid stochastic/robust approach to construct a set of ambiguity constraints to restrict the ETC's trading revenue to minimum profit levels. The benefits of the proposed model is illustrated with real data from the Brazilian system, where the approach presented was contrasted with the classical risk-constrained model and both are benchmarked against historical variables.

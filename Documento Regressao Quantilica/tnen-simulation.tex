\section{Simulation}
\label{sec:simulation}

In this section, we investigate how to simulate future paths of the time series $y_t$. 
%We use this model to produce $K$ future values for the time serie $y_t$. 
Let $n$ be the total number of observations of $y_t$. We produce $S$ different paths with size $K$ for each. 
We have $n$ observations of $y_t$ and we want to produce . Given a vector of explanatory variables $x_t$, let $q_\alpha(x_t)$ be given by the $\alpha$-quantile estimated as described on section \ref{sec:estimating-distribution}.

The variables chosen to compose $x_t$ can be either exogenous variables, autoregressive components of $y_t$ or both. As the distribution of $\varepsilon_t$ is unknown, we have to use a nonparametric approach in order to estimate its one-step ahead density.

The coefficients $\beta_{0 \alpha}$ and $\beta_{\alpha}$ are the solution of the minimization problem given in the problem defined in (\ref{eq:non-crossing-quantiles1})-(\ref{eq:non-crossing-constraint}), reproduced here for convenience:
\begin{eqnarray}
\min_{q_\alpha,\varepsilon_{t,\alpha}^{+}, \varepsilon_{t,\alpha}^{-}} &  \sum_{\alpha \in A} \sum_{t \in T}\left(\alpha \varepsilon_{t,\alpha}^{+}+(1-\alpha)\varepsilon_{t,\alpha}^{-}\right) &  \\
\mbox{s.t. } & \varepsilon_{t,\alpha}^{+}-\varepsilon_{t,\alpha}^{-}=y_{t} - q_\alpha(x_{t}), & \qquad\forall t \in T_\tau,\forall \alpha \in A,\\
& \varepsilon_{t,\alpha}^+,\varepsilon_{t,\alpha}^- \geq 0, & \qquad\forall t \in T_\tau,\forall \alpha \in A,\\ 
& q_{\alpha}(x_t) \leq q_{\alpha'}(x_t), & \qquad \forall t \in T_\tau, \forall (\alpha, \alpha') \in A \times A,  \alpha < \alpha', 
\end{eqnarray}

To produce $S$ different paths of $\{ \hat{y}_t \}_{t=n+1}^{n+K}$, we use the following procedure:

Procedure for simulating $S$ scenarios of $y_t$

\begin{enumerate}
	
\item At first, let $\tau = n + 1$.

\item In any given period $\tau$, for every $\alpha \in A$, we use the problem defined on  (\ref{eq:non-crossing-quantiles1})-(\ref{eq:non-crossing-constraint}) to estimate quantiles 
 $q_\alpha(x_{\tau})$.
Note that $x_{\tau}$ is supposed to be known at time $\tau$. In the presence of exogenous variables that are unknown, it is advisable to incorporate its uncertainty by considering different scenarios. In each scenario, though, $x_{\tau}$ must be considered fully known. 
 
\item Let $\hat{Q}_{y_{\tau}|X=x_\tau}(\alpha,x_\tau)$ be the estimated quantile function of ${y}_{\tau}$. 
To estimate $\hat{Q}_{y_{\tau}}$, we first define a discrete quantile function $\tilde{Q}_{y_\tau}$. By mapping every $\alpha \in A$ with its estimated quantile $\hat{q}_{\alpha}$, we define function $\tilde{Q}_{y_{\tau}}$. When we interpolate 

This process is described in more details on section \ref{sec:estimating-distribution}.

\item Once we have a distribution for $y_{n+1}$, we can generate $S$ different simulated values, drawn from the distribution function $\hat{F}_{y_{n+1}} = \hat{Q}^{-1}_{y_{\tau}}$, derived from the quantile function found by doing steps 2 and 3. 
Let $X$ be a random variable with uniform distribution over the interval $[0,1]$. By using results from the Probability Integral Transform, we know that the random variable $F^{-1}_{y_{n+1}}(X)$ has the same distribution as $y_{n+1}$. So, by drawing a sample of size $S$ from $X$ and applying the quantile function $Q_{y_{n+1}}(\alpha)$, we have our sample of size $K$ for $y_{n+1}$.

\item Each one of the $S$ different values for $y_{n+1}$ will be the starting point of a different path. Now, for each $\tau \in [n+2,n+K]$ and $s \in S$, we have to estimate quantiles $q_{\alpha \tau, s}$ and find a quantile function for $\hat{Q}_{y_{\tau,s}}$ just like it was done on steps 2 and 3.
Note that when $\tau > n+2$, every estimate will be scenario dependent, hence there will be $S$ distribution functions estimated for each period $\tau$. From now on, in each path just one new value will be drawn randomly from the one-step ahead distribution function - as opposed to what was carried on step 3, when $S$ values were simulated. As there will be $S$ distribution functions - one for each path, in each period $\tau$ it will be produced exact $S$ values for $y_\tau$, one for its own path. Repeating this step until all values of $\tau$ and $s$ are simulated will give us the full simulations that we are looking for.

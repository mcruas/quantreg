\begin{abstract}
	Within competitive electricity markets, supply contracts plays an important role. They help ensure supply adequacy and mitigate market power, among other benefits. However, when renewable energy is involved, the mixture of an uncertain energy production with a high volatile short-term market poses a risk difficult to manage. Within this context, call options are suitable hedging instruments due to the right to purchase relatively cheap energy to cover renewable unbalances (with respect to supply contracts) in periods of spot price spikes. To efficiently balance the cost/benefit of a set of call options in a portfolio of renewable sources short in supply contracts, a precise definition of the probabilistic nature of the short-term market price should be available. However, it is recognized that in practice agents only have an imprecise approximation of the ``true'' underlying process. Thus, decisions are made under \textit{ambiguity}. Therefore, the standard pure stochastic approach for optimal composition of electricity contracts may not be suitable. In this work, we propose a risk and ambiguity-adjusted portfolio allocation model that defines the optimal composition of call options and renewable sources to back a forward contract. A case study with real data from the Brazilian power system is presented.

\DIFdelend \IEEEPARstart{R}{enewable} energy expansion has been growing worldwide, mainly in response to governmental incentive for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, wind-power generation (WPG) is one of the largest sources of renewable energy, and according to the International Energy Agency, will respond to 18\% of global power by 2050  \cite{IntEnerAgency}. However the uncertainty associated with its non dispatchable nature may jeopardize reliability of electricity supply. In attempting to minimize this kind of risk it is highly desirable to produce reliable forecasts and scenarios for WPG time series. The importance of such scenarios emerges in many instance, as for example: (i) energy trading, (ii) unit commitment, (iii) grid expansion planning, and (iv) investment decisions (see (\cite{moreiraStreet,jabr2013robust,zhaoguan,Aderson2017}) and references therein). %DIF > Nevertheless, even though there is plenty of literature 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{There is a vast literature on stochastic optimization models devoted to address the relevant issues on the aforementioned power system applications. Notwithstanding, few papers focus on addressing the gaps on the subject of joint scenario generation despite the high sensibility of the stochastic optimization models with regard to their input scenarios.

%In this paper, a methodology to generate long-term joint scenarios for time series of capacity factors (CF) associated with different wind plants is proposed. Modelling and simulating such a set of time series imposes two major challenges, namely: (i) the intrinsic non Gaussian nature of CF time series. (ii) the possibility of non linear dependence among these series. In order to properly address these two characteristics of CF time series we propose the use of a new class of time series models, the Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS)  \cite{creal2013generalized} or Dynamic Conditional Score (DCS), following \cite{harvey2013dynamic}.%Another  strong seasonal pattern, which conventional autoregressive models cannot handle straightforward. To empirically illustrate such facts, we provide in Figure \ref{BoxPlots_IC_mensal} an annual plot of CF from one wind plant located at the Northeast of Brazil, namely Icaraizinho (here and after denoted as IC).

%In addition to the strong seasonal pattern presented by Figure \ref{BoxPlots_IC_mensal}, another important stylized fact of CF time series is provided, season effects. During the first half of the year, wind speed tends to decrease and also its frequency. As an outcome, the CF of these months will naturally drop. On the other hand, during the second semester, the opposite happens.




%and the non Gaussian pattern of such variable, which is statistically confirmed by the
%Another evidence, which corroborates with our Moreover, checking each month empirical density, it is possible to conclude that they are asymmetric, and when calculating theirs values, August`s skewness is the closest to zero, in modulus, with a value of 0.1306.

%The non Gaussian nature of CF time series, in most applications in the energy literature, is not directly dealt with, either because of non availability of proper software or by the computational burden in implementing existing non Gaussian models. For example, if one decides to fit a non-Gaussian state space model using unobserved components, such as trend, seasonals and cycle, it would be necessary extensive Monte Carlo simulation for both state and fixed parameter estimation. See, for example, Durbin and Koopman (2012, pp 209-324). In practice a great deal of applied work involving scenario generation for wind speed or CF time series make use of ARMA models and its extensions, \cite{box1976time}, mostly under normality assumption. At best such models are fitted to the log of the variable of interest, and by taking the anti log, predictions and simulations on the original scale of the variable are obtained. Unfortunately such a strategy can result in unrealistic sampling paths for the original variable.

%Hence, the need to apply the $log$ transformation and then fit the data properly. Yet, it is also a non conventional form, as it is known, to come back to the original scale, it is necessary the exponentiation of simulated Gaussian values that can result in unrealistic sampling paths as can be seen in Figure \ref{SARIMA_COM_TRANS} where we simulate 2000 scenarios 12 steps ahead.




%, and by propagation, this can badly affect the risk measures obtained from the simulated distribution of the cash flows associated with a particular portfolio of wind plants. %our approach can generate scenarios in just one step, avoiding the need of transforming back the outcome variables to its original scale, as it is the case under a Gaussian assumption for the marginal models. As it is known, exponentiation of simulated Gaussian values can result in unrealistic sampling paths for the wind capacity factor. 

%Isso cria uma motivacao para o estabelecimento de modelos que sejam capazes de modelar series nao gaussianas e que contemplem a questao de nao linearidade

%Such features motivates the insertion of a recently proposed time series framework which gracefully handles with the two aforementioned challenges. In this paper we applied to monthly  wind capacity factor (CF) time series a newly proposed class of observation-driven time series models, the so called GAS models \cite{creal2013generalized} or Dynamic Conditional Score (DCS), following \cite{harvey2013dynamic}. Our approach fits in the classification proposed by \cite{zhang2014review} as a long-term parametric probabilistic. More specifically one can pick any desirable predictive distribution judged appropriate for the response variable being modelled and, trough the dynamic equations proposed in the GAS frameworks, make its parameters time varying. We advocate that wind probabilistic forecasting should be preferred in practice since from it, apart from conditional measures of location, like mean or median, one can obtain many different measures of interest, like conditional quantiles, enabling improved decision making to power systems operators and investors.

%However, for several applications, such as unit commitment, regulation and commercialization, these variables are plugged into the power curve to transform wind speed/wind power into a CF time series. The models here proposed are directly fitted to the CF time series which are directly available, and as consequence  no such transformations will be needed. \cite{zhang2014review} presents a detailed review of state-of-the-art methods and new developments in wind power uncertainty forecasting. 
%As \cite{mur2010variability} conclude, wind power generation is a non-linear and non-stationary process, which are also features of wind speed time series. Therefore common choices of models that could reproduce its pattern use time series models (e.g. \cite{brown1984time}) or Artificial Intelligence \cite{sideratos2012probabilistic}. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Much }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In contrast to the main objective of WPG simulation methods, which aim to produce scenarios that characterize all the conditional density and its fit to the observed quantile data, much }\DIFaddend research has been devoted to devise short-term forecast methods for wind speed and WPG time series (for instance, see \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

In \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{many applications , the modeling of these time series }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{some applications on medium and long-term forecast, the time series model }\DIFaddend is conducted using conventional ARMA models with seasonal lags, or SARIMA models, under a Gaussian distribution (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{see \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{souto2014high}
}%DIFAUXCMD
for a high-dimension estimation process based on LASSO}\DIFaddend ). In its original formulation, SARIMA models present a fixed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{scale parameter}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{conditional variance}\DIFaddend . To add extra flexibility to these models \cite{lau2010approaches} proposes an ARIMA model with GARCH effect, allowing the conditional variance of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{wind power }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the WPG }\DIFaddend distribution to vary over time. Also, to provide a description of the spatial correlation of wind-speed time series, \cite{taylor2009wind} proposed an Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated-GARCH model (ARFIMA-GARCH). In these and other models, conditional on the past, the distribution of the response variable is assumed Gaussian.

The non-Gaussian nature of WPG time series is well reported in the literature (see \cite{bessa2012time,jeon2012using,taylor2015forecasting,Wan2017} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend and references therein). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Notwithstanding}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{However}\DIFaddend , only very limited classes of non-Gaussian time-series models \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{were available for forecasting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are available for modeling }\DIFaddend WPG. The state of the art literature on short-term probabilistic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{forecast of WPG }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{modeling of WPG time series }\DIFaddend mainly rely on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{nonparametric }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{non-parametric }\DIFaddend models. For instance, in \cite{bessa2012time} and \cite{Wan2017}, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{nonparametric }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{non-parametric }\DIFaddend approaches were devised to forecast conditional distributions. While in \cite{bessa2012time} kernel density estimators \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend employed to build a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{density forecast}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{predictive conditional density function}\DIFaddend , in \cite{Wan2017} a quantile-regression-based model was used. Despite the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{computational }\DIFdelend virtues found in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{estimation for non-parametric methods, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{nonparametric methods, those models require a lot of data to be fitted and are mainly devised for the univariate case. Thus, }\DIFaddend the development of new parametric models capable to properly characterize the full \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{multivariate }\DIFaddend non-Gaussian distribution for WPG time series is a relevant research theme, which did not received too much attention so far. Relevant applications arise from risk assessment in both \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{medium- }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{medium }\DIFaddend and long-term planning/investment studies, which mainly rely on few data points to characterize conditional estimates of extreme quantiles \cite{FosteringWPP,SHAPIRO2013,Fanzeres2015,Aderson2017,kariniotakis2017renewable}\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {\color{red}%%%

\DIFdelend .

In \cite{creal2013generalized} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, a General Autoregressive Score (GAS) model was proposed to derive and estimate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{harvey2013dynamic}

\cite{creal2013generalized}
}%DIFAUXCMD
and Dynamic Conditional Score (DCS) \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{harvey2013dynamic}
}%DIFAUXCMD
. In \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{creal2013generalized}
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , it has been shown that several well-known time-series models from the econometric literature are a particular case of GAS models\footnote{For instance, GARCH models that deal with heavy tailed distributions in finance \cite{engle1986modelling}, Autoregressive Conditional Duration models \cite{engle1998autoregressive} to tackle asymmetric distributions in finance applications such as time duration, and the Poisson count models of Davis \cite{davis2003observation} are particular cases of GAS models.}. More specifically, a GAS model is built based on a user-defined conditional \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{density }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{probability }\DIFaddend function whose parameters follow a data-driven dynamic equation, generally on the form of an autoregressive mechanism. Then, by construction, time-varying parameters can be accommodated according to an updating mechanism that uses the score as its driving force. The use of the score function for updating time-varying parameters is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{intuitive given that it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an intuitive choice. It }\DIFaddend is defined as the steepest ascent direction (gradient) for improving the local fit of the model in terms of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend likelihood. In such an updating mechanism, information from the whole density is used to track the evolution of time varying parameters. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Several applications from finance to oil }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Most of the applications }\DIFaddend using GAS models have been published in the recent \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{econometric literature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{literature of finance and economics}\DIFaddend . We refer the interested reader to the main on-line repository on GAS papers \cite{GASwebpage}. The virtue of GAS models to address non-linear and non-Gaussian time series \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{models recognized in the recent literature }\DIFdelend notwithstanding, to the best of the authors' knowledge \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend there is no publication in the power systems literature using \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GAS models}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{such framework}\DIFaddend . The consideration of a seasonal structure in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{such models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the updating mechanism for the time-varying parameters }\DIFaddend was also not addressed in the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GAS }\DIFaddend literature so far, despite being a relevant structure shared by a wide range of time series such as WPG (see \cite{tseng2002fuzzy,lei2009review,FosteringWPP,souto2014high} and references therein).

%DIF > Additionally, it is crucial to incorporate spatial dependence information when simulating multivariate scenarios in applications involving many different generation units \cite{souto2014high}, e.g. unit commitment, energy trading, just to mention a few. %More commonly, such dependence is usually captured by the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ \cite{pinson2009probabilistic}. For example, \cite{morales2010methodology} uses a multivariate ARMA model and employed the variance-covariance matrix to characterize the spatial-temporal correlation of wind speed distribution. 
%DIF > In our approach, the dependence structure among the WPG time series for different power plants will be captured through an elliptical copula applied to the residuals of the univariate GAS models. In order to allow the consideration of a time-varying spatial dependence, the copula parameter will be updated by a GAS mechanism, similar to \cite{creal2011dynamic}. Copula-based models are very flexible to construct multivariate distributions, since they allow the specification of the models for the marginals distributions (in our case the beta GAS models) separately from the dependence structure given by the copula.
%DIF > Details on estimation and inference for copulas applied to time series can be found in \cite{cherubini2004copula,joe2005asymptotic, patton2012copula, patton2009copula, patton2006modelling, patton2002applications}. %The adoption of a time-varying correlation matrix for the copula is needed to incorporate the different spatial-dependence regimes observed along seasons \cite{souto2014high,vecchia1985maximum}.% In our set up the correlation matrix will also evolve in time according to a second step GAS procedure as presented in \cite{creal2011dynamic}%, which will makes it easier to capture and correct for outlier effects.

%DIF < r example, one could use extensions of state space models to non-Gaussian environments (see, for example, \cite{durbin2012time}), but extensive Monte Carlo simulation is required to numerically evaluate the conditional densities that define the estimation process of such models. The high technicalities involved in implementing these algorithms and its accompanying computational cost have not helped its widespread use by practitioners. On the other hand, different attempts to extend ARMA type models with conditional non Gaussian distributions have been more successful. For example, the use of GARCH type models to deal with heavy tailed distributions in finance \cite{engle1986modelling}, the Autoregressive Conditional Duration (ACD) \cite{engle1998autoregressive} model to tackle asymmetric distributions in time duration and the Poisson count models of Davis \cite{davis2003observation} for the modeling of discrete events in time. But, so far, these extensions have lacked an unifying framework that would allow the specification, estimation and forecasting of a model based on an arbitrary non Gaussian distribution. The recently proposed GAS models \cite{creal2013generalized}) offer an unifying framework to derive and estimate time series model with any conditional non-Gaussian distribution, either discrete or continuous, univariate or multivariate. More specifically, in GAS models, conditional on past observations, a proper probability model, possibly non Gaussian, is chosen for the response variable at time $t$. Then, by construction, time varying parameters can be accommodated according to an updating mechanism that uses the score as its driving force. The use of the score for updating time-varying parameters is intuitive given that it defines the steepest ascent direction for improving the model's local fit in terms of the likelihood or density at time $t$, given the current parameter position. In such an updating mechanism information from the whole density is used to track the evolution of time varying parameters.% Analogous to the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), in the GAS framework it is also necessary to specify appropriate links functions, if time-varying parameters are defined in subsets of the real line. In addition, stationary and ergodicity properties of such models shall not be discussed in this paper, nevertheless it were already proven under some specific cases in \cite{blasques2014stationarity}.

%DIF < In spite of most of the final users having interest in the capacity factor (CF\footnote{Capacity factor is an average power generated over a period of time, divided by the maximum power of the wind turbine}) as the final outcome variable, the majority of the proposed methodologies in the literature  are mainly concerned in converting wind speed density forecasts to wind power density forecasts through the power curve. With these results in hands, it is then possible to calculate the CF of the former wind turbine.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < In our problem set we have several wind plants from which one needs to generate joint scenarios for CF. The need for such scenarios can arise in many practical problems. For example, such scenarios can be used as input for regulatory purposes, such as the study of a new method to calculate firm energy certificates for wind plants, and also for commercialization strategies firmed at the Free Trade Environment (FTE). Such environment is part of the Brazilian electricity market where investors are able to buy contracts associated with wind plants thorough an auction system (see \cite{barroso2011offering} and references therein). It is then natural in such a decision process to evaluate the risk associated with contracts acquired to buy future energy that will be provided by a portfolio of wind plants. For evaluation purpose it is then necessary to jointly simulate capacity factor for wind plants.

%DIF < The parametric assumption is, somehow, important. Since the distribution shape only depends on a few parameters, when dealing with parametric approaches, the computational burden reduces \cite{zhang2014review}. Nevertheless, it is not reasonable to assume that wind power predictive density shape will not vary over time, due to its strong seasonal pattern. However, it is very complex to deal with multi-modal distributions, therefore non-parametric approaches figures as feasible alternatives, but computationally expensive.
%DIF < We develop a model that lies inside the parametric approach to represent the wind power generation and does not need to transform variables.

%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < Indeed methods for wind power density forecasting are much less developed. The most direct approach to fulfill such task is proposing a time series model for the marginal densities, but due to the non-linearity of wind power it is not that simple. Therefore, the former reason justifies the use of the power curve to relate wind power and wind speed densities forecasting. To represent wind power uncertainty, one could use probabilistic forecasting \cite{bremnes2004probabilistic}, risk index \cite{pinson2004line} and scenario forecasting \cite{pinson2009probabilistic}.

%DIF < Given the empirical evidence of positive correlation between the time series of CF's, it is crucial to incorporate such information when generating the joint scenarios. More commonly, such dependence is usually captured by estimating a covariance matrix $\Sigma$ \cite{pinson2009probabilistic}.  For example, \cite{morales2010methodology} uses a multivariate ARMA model and employed the variance-covariance matrix to characterize the spatial-temporal correlation of wind speed distribution. Under the multivariate assumption, a Vector Autoregressive Moving Average-GARCH model was employed to describe the bivariate wind vector time-series \cite{jeon2012using}. 
%DIF < 
%DIF < The generation of joint scenarios for a vector of time series is accomplished by use of a multivariate time series model, as for example, a vector auto regression (VAR) under the assumption of a multivariate conditional Gaussian distribution. In this paper, instead of specifying such a distribution from the outset, the multivariate distribution will be constructed by joining the marginal distributions associated with each individual time series via a copula. The use of copulas will make it possible to capture dependence, possibly non-linear, among the time series of CF's associated with plants in different geographical sites.
%DIF < 
%DIF < In our work, the dependence structure among the time series of wind plants is captured through a Student t copula with time-varying correlation matrix \cite{creal2011dynamic} and fixed degrees of freedom. Copula-based models are very flexible  to construct multivariate distributions, since they allow the specification of the models for the marginals distributions (in our case the beta GAS models)separately from the dependence structure given by the copula.
%DIF < Details on estimation and inference for copulas applied to time series can be seen in \cite{cherubini2004copula,joe2005asymptotic, patton2012copula, patton2009copula, patton2006modelling, patton2002applications}. The adoption of a time-varying correlation matrix for the copula is justified by the fact that correlation among wind plants time series are not constant over time due to the fact that wind have different regimes depending on seasons. In our set up the correlation matrix will also evolve in time according to an appropriate GAS mechanism, which will makes it easier to capture and correct for outlier effects, as presented in \cite{creal2011dynamic}. %Nevertheless, it does not seems reasonable to assume that the dependence structure among such variables will be constant, therefore we propose a copula model with a time-varying correlation matrix also being update trough a GAS mechanism.

%DIF < In addition, as already mentioned in the introduction, when dealing with a decision-making problem, it seems more reasonable to use probability forecast which can provide a whole new set of quantitative information. In this sense it is commonly used, to reproduce such uncertainty, a Probability Density Function (PDFs) or a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDFs). Furthermore, it was proposed in the literature the use of Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) \cite{bessa2012time} and Quantile Regression (QR) \cite{bremnes2004probabilistic}.% Nevertheless, KDE suffer from the boundary effect problem \cite{wand1994kernel} and QR from the crossing-quantiles one [???].

\DIFaddend 

Our time series data comprises monthly \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{wind CF}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{WPG}\DIFaddend , from January 1981 to December 2011, measured at three wind plants located in the Brazilian Northeast, namely: Rio do Fogo (RF), Icaraizinho (IC) and Enacel (EN). The last year of these time series were kept for out of sample \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{forecasting evaluation. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{scenario evaluation. The intrinsic non-Gaussian nature of WPG time series can be easily shown by observing the shape of a qq-plot or by running a simple normality test, such as the Jarque-Bera test. Considering individually each of the three time series of WPG, the null hypothesis of normality for each of these time series has been rejected (p-values $<$ 0.001). Likewise, considering QQ-plot depicted in Figure \ref{qq_IC} of IC unit, it strongly suggest non normality through the observed positive skewness, which suggest strong adequacy of our proposed beta GAS model.

\hat{P}_Q^\alpha = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \eta_t

\DIFadd{The reability will provide the deviation between the empirical proportion $\hat{P}_Q^\alpha$ and nominal proportion $\alpha$ of the predicted quantiles.

we propose a non Gaussian model to filter wind CF dynamic. By doing such, one does not need to transform variables and work with the $log$ of the observed data point, our framework is taylor made for the range of values that CF's time series can assume. In addition, the simulated values will be always inside physical limits of production, i. e. , it will never assume values bigger than the maximum production of wind plant $i$.

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In this paper we proposed a framework to simulate joint scenarios of WPG time series taking into account the spatial dependence among different units. Such scenarios are deeply demanded for the development of medium- and long-term studies for power-system planning under uncertainty of renewable energy generation. Our methodology seems fruitful and have several benefits when comparing against a benchmark SARIMA model, regarding its parametric features and the straightforward way to estimate and generate extreme quantiles. The proposed framework was derived making use of a recently proposed class of time-series models with time-varying parameters and arbitrary non Gaussian distribution, known as Generalized Auto Regressive Score models (GAS). When adopting such models, one does not need to transform WPG and work with the $log$ of the observed data point. Our framework is taylor made for the range of values that WPG time series can assume. In addition, copula models were used to input spatial dependence into the generated joint scenarios. Its use is unarguably better when comparing the extreme scenarios to the ones generated by the SARIMA model.

\section{\DIFadd{Gas mechanism for the multivariate Student t distribution}}\label{FirstAppendix}

\DIFadd{In this appendix we present the elements of the GAS mechanism $s_t$, $\nabla_{t}$ and $\mathcal{I}_{t|t-1}^{-1}$ for the multivariate Student t distribution, but first let us define a few matrix notations. The matrix $\mathcal{D}_{K}$ is a duplication matrix given by $\mathcal{D}_{K}vech(C) = vec(C)$ and the Kronecker product of two matrixes $C$ and $D$ is denoted by $C \otimes D$. In case $C=D$, $C_{\otimes}$. By convenience the operator $vec(C)$ creates a column vector from a matrix $C$ by stacking the column vectors of $C$ while $vech(C)$ also creates a column vector stacking only column vectors of the inferior triangular part of $C$. For a full detailed review on linear algebra operators, please see \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{abadir2005matrix}

}

\DIFadd{Now, the proposed GAS mechanism in\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{creal2011dynamic}
}%DIFAUXCMD
to update the time varying correlation matrix $\Sigma_t$ using a multivariate Student t is given by 
  }

\begin{align}\DIFadd{ 
\nabla_{t} = \frac{\partial \ln p(\tilde{y}_{t}|\Sigma_{t};\nu)}{\partial f_{t}} =}& \DIFadd{\frac{1}{2} \Psi_{t}^{'} \mathcal{D}_{K}^{'}\Sigma_{t\otimes}^{-1}[w_{t}\tilde{y}_{t\otimes}-vec(\Sigma_{t})] \label{nabla} }\\
\DIFadd{\mathcal{I}_{t|t-1} = E}[\DIFadd{\nabla_{t}\nabla_{t}^{'}}] \DIFadd{=}& \DIFadd{\frac{1}{4} \Psi_{t}^{'} \mathcal{D}_{K}^{'}J_{t\otimes}^{'}[gZ-vec(I)vec(I)^{'}] \label{info} }\\ & \DIFadd{J_{t\otimes}\mathcal{D}_{K}\Psi_{t} \nonumber
}\end{align}
\noindent
\DIFadd{where $\Psi_{t}=\partial vech(\Sigma_{t})/\partial f_{t}^{'}$ which will be presented next in Equation }\eqref{derivPSI}\DIFadd{, the scalar $w_{t}=(\nu+K)/(\nu-2+\tilde{y}_{t}^{'}\Sigma_{t}^{-1}\tilde{y}_{t})$ reduces the effects of outliers, once the former quantity is divided by $\tilde{y}_{t}^{'}\Sigma_{t}^{-1}\tilde{y}_{t}$. Matrix $J_{t}$ is defined as $\Sigma^{-1}_{t}=J^{'}_{t}J_{t}$, which can be obtained by any matrix decomposition procedure. In our application in Section \ref{Application}, we adopted Cholesky decomposition. The scalar $g=(\nu+K)/(\nu+2+K)$ and the elements of the square matrix $Z$ of dimension $K\times K$, are given by
}\begin{align}\DIFadd{ 
Z}[\DIFadd{(i-1)\cdot k+\ell,(j-1)\cdot k+m}]\DIFadd{=\delta_{ij}\delta_{\ell m} + \delta_{i\ell}\delta_{j m} +  \delta_{im}\delta_{j \ell}
}\end{align}
\noindent
\DIFadd{with $i,j,\ell,m=1,...,K$, assuming $\delta_{ij}$ equals to 1 if $i=j$ and zero otherwise. 
}

\DIFadd{As previously discussed, the key to define a copula framework in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{creal2011dynamic}
}%DIFAUXCMD
is to use the following specification of $\Psi_{t}$ in Equations }\eqref{nabla}\DIFadd{-}\eqref{info}\DIFadd{,
}\begin{equation}\DIFadd{ \label{derivPSI}
\Psi_{t} = \mathcal{B}_{K}D_{t\otimes}\Delta^{-1}_{t\otimes}[\mathcal{D}_{K}-(\Delta_{t} \oplus Q_{t})\Delta_{t\otimes}^{-1}W_{\Delta_{t}}\mathcal{S}_{\Delta}]\mathcal{S}_{Q}
}\end{equation}
\noindent
\DIFadd{where $\mathcal{S}_{Q}=I$ since $f_{t}=vech(Q_{t})$. The matrix $W_{\Delta_{t}}$ is initially calculated using a diagonal matrix of dimension $K^{2} \times K^{2}$ with elements of the main diagonal equals to $0.5vec(\Delta^{-1}_{t})$, and later the columns of zeros are eliminated. The matrix $\mathcal{S}_{\Delta}$ is a selection matrix, with ones and zeros, given by $diag(\Delta^{2}_{t})=\mathcal{S}_{\Delta}vech(Q_{t})$. The operator $\oplus$ is given by $C\oplus D=(C\otimes D)+(D\otimes C)$. In addition, $\mathcal{B}_{K}=(\mathcal{D}_{K}^{'}\mathcal{D}_{K})^{-1}\mathcal{D}_{K}^{'}$ is a duplication matrix composed by only zeros and ones, with more lines than columns. $\Delta_{t}$ is a diagonal matrix which elements are the square root of the elements contained in the main diagonal of $Q_{t}$

\section{Estimating distribution function from quantile regressions}
\label{sec:estimating-distribution}

In many applications where a time series model is employed, we often consider the innovations' distribution as known. Take, for example, the AR(p) model:
$$Y=c+\sum_{i=1}^{p}\phi_{i}X_i+\varepsilon_{t},$$
where $X_i$ is a past value of random variable $Y$.
In this model, errors $\varepsilon_t$ are assumed to have normal distribution with zero mean. 

When we are dealing with natural resources data, however, we can't always assume normality. In these cases, one can either find a distribution that has a better fit to the data or have a nonparametric method to estimate the distribution directly from the available data.

In a time series framework, where a time series $y_t$ is given by a linear model of its regressors $x_t$
$$Y_t = \beta^T X_t + \varepsilon_t,$$
we propose to estimate the $k$-step ahead distribution of $Y_t$ with a nonparametric approach.
Let an empirical $\alpha$-quantile $\hat{q}_\alpha \in \mathcal{Q}$ be a functional belonging to a functional space. In any given $t$, we can estimate the sequence of quantiles $\{ q_{\alpha}(x_t) \}_{\alpha \in A}$ by solving the problem defined on equations (\ref{eq:non-crossing-quantiles1})-(\ref{eq:non-crossing-constraint}). 
 After evaluating this sequence, by making equal 
\begin{equation}
\hat{Q}_{y_t|X=x_t}(\alpha) = \hat{q}_\alpha(x_t), \qquad \forall \alpha \in A,
\end{equation}
we have a set of size $|A|$ of values to define the discrete function over the first argument $\hat{Q}_{y_t|x_t}(\alpha,X=x_t): A \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The goal of having function $\hat{Q}$ is to use it as base to construct the estimated quantile function $\hat{Q}'_{y_t|X=x_t}(\alpha,x_t): [0,1] \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. 

A problem arises for the distribution extremities, because when $\alpha = 0$ or $\alpha = 1$, the optimization problem becomes unbounded. In order to find values for $\hat{Q}(\alpha,x_t)$ when $\alpha \in \{0,1\}$, we chose to linearly extrapolate its values. %completar com explicação de extrapolação
Note that as $A \subset [0,1]$, the domain of $\hat{Q}$ is also a subset of the domain of $\hat{Q}'$. 
The estimative of $\hat{Q}'$ is done by interpolating points of $\hat{Q}$ over the interval $[0,1]$.
Thus, the distribution found for $\hat{y}_{\tau}$ is nonparametric, as no previous assumptions are made about its shape, and its form is fully recovered by the data we have.


We investigate two different approaches for $Q_{y_t}$ by the functional structure of each individual $q_\alpha(x_t)$.
In section \ref{sec:linear-models}, we explore the case where the individual quantiles $q_\alpha(x_t)$ are a linear function of its arguments:
\begin{equation}
\hat{q}_\alpha(x_t) = \beta_{0,\alpha} +   \beta_\alpha^T x_t,
\label{eq:fun-quantile}
\end{equation}
where $\beta^\alpha$ is a vector of coefficients for the explanatory variables.

In section \ref{sec:npqar} we introduce a Nonparametric Quantile Autoregressive model with a $\ell_{1}$-penalty term, in order to properly simulate densities for several $\alpha$-quantiles. In this nonparametric approach we don't assume any form for $q_\alpha(x_t)$, but rather let the function adjust to the data. To prevent overfitting, the $\ell_1$ penalty for the second derivative (approximated by the second difference of the ordered observations) is included in the objective function. The result of this optimization problem is that each $q_\alpha(x_t)$ will be a function with finite second derivative.

In order to find good estimates for $Q_{y_{t}}(\alpha)$ when $\alpha$ approaches 0 or 1, as well as performing interpolation on the values that were not directly estimated, we can either use a kernel smoothing function, splines, linear approximation, or any other method.

\subsection{A comparison between both approaches}

The last two sections introduced two different strategies to arrive in a Quantile Function $Q_{y_t|X}$. But what are the differences between using one method or the other? 

To provide a comparison between both approaches, we estimate a quantile function to predict the one-step ahead quantile function. We use as explanatory variable only the last observation $y_{t-1}$ - so $x_t = y_{t-1}$ - and estimate $\hat{q}_\alpha(y_{t-1})$, for every $\alpha \in \{0.05, 0.1, \dots, 0.9, 0.95 \}$. The result of both methods is shown on Figure \ref{fig:scatterplot-alphaquantiles}.

While the linear model produces $\alpha$-quantile functions which are linear by imposition, on the nonparametric model the $\alpha$-quantiles are flexible enough to form a hull on the data and adapt to its nonlinearities. The difference between the estimated quantile functions $\hat{Q}_{y_t|y_{t-1}}$ on both methods are shown on Figure \ref{fig:scatterplot-alphaquantiles}.

It is also important to test how the choice of the set $A$ affects the estimated quantile function. We experimented with two different sizes of $A$. In one of them, a dense grid of probabilities is used:   $A=\{0.005, 0.01, \dots, 0.99, 0.995 \}$, consisting of 199 elements. On the other only 19 elements are used to produce the quantile function ($A=\{0.05, 0.1, \dots, 0.9, 0.95 \}$).

\subsection{Testing convergence}

In this computational exercise, we simulated the following stochastic process:
\begin{equation}
Y_t = \rho Y_{t-1}+ \varepsilon_t,\qquad \varepsilon_t \sim LogNormal(\mu,\sigma^2),
\end{equation}
to test how fast the estimated quantile function $\hat{Q}'_{Y|X}$ converges to the real $Q_{Y|X}$, using the parametric approach. An error metric defined as 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\alpha \in A} | \hat{Q}'_{Y|X}(\alpha) - Q_{Y|X}(\alpha) |
\end{equation}
is measured for different values of size of data.
The result is shown on figure \ref{fig:convergence}.
